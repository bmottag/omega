		<li>Use arms to protect head and neck.</li>
		<li>Remain sheltered until the tornado threat is announced to be over.</li>
	</ul>';
	
	
	$html .= '<h4 style="color:#337ab7;">Earthquake:</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Stay calm and await instructions from the Emergency Coordinator or the designated official.</li>
		<li>Keep away from overhead fixtures, windows, filing cabinets, and electrical power.</li>
		<li>Assist people with disabilities in finding a safe place.</li>

		If indoors:

		<li>Be ready to evacuate as directed by the Emergency Coordinator and/or the designated official.</li>
		<li>Follow the recommended primary or secondary evacuation routes.</li>
	</ul>

		<li>Avoid walking or driving through flood water.</li>
		<li>If car stalls, abandon it immediately and climb to a higher ground.</li>

	$html .= '<h4 style="color:#337ab7;">Blizzard:</h4>

		If indoors:
	<ul>
		<li>Stay calm and await instructions from the Emergency Coordinator or the designated official.</li>
		<li>Stay indoors.</li>
		<li>If there is no heat:
			<ul>
				<li>Close off unneeded rooms or areas.</li>
				<li>Stuff towels or rags in cracks under doors.</li>
				<li>Cover windows at night.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>Eat and drink. Food provides the body with energy and heat. Fluids prevent dehydration.</li>
		<li>Wear layers of loose-fitting, light-weight, warm clothing, if available.</li>
	</ul>
	
		If outdoors:
	<ul>
		<li>Find a dry shelter. Cover all exposed parts of the body.</li>
		<li>If shelter is not available:
			<ul>
				<li>Prepare a lean-to, wind break, or snow cave for protection from the wind.</li>
				<li>Build a fire for heat and to attract attention. Place rocks around the fire to absorb and reflect heat.</li>
				<li>Do not eat snow. It will lower your body temperature. Melt it first.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

		If stranded in a car or truck:
	<ul>
		<li>Stay in the vehicle.</li>
		<li>Run the motor about ten minutes each hour. Open
the windows a little for fresh air to avoid carbon
monoxide poisoning. Make sure the exhaust pipe is
not blocked.</li>
		<li>Make yourself visible to rescuers.
			<ul>
				<li>Turn on the dome light at night when running the engine.</li>
				<li>Tie a colored cloth to your antenna or door.</li>
				<li>Raise the hood after the snow stops falling.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Exercise to keep blood circulating and to keep warm.</li>
	</ul>
